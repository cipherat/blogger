# Birth of idea
I wanted to create my own blog site to publish my writings. But, as a software engineer, I couldn't drag myself to use an already implemented tool, so I made my own.

_I also took database and data structures courses this Fall, so a good project to test what I learned_


# ToDo features list:
- [ ] categorize blogs
- [ ] drafted and published blogs
- [ ] sort by (i.e. name, date, etc.)
- [ ] rating system for readers
- [ ] commenting system for readers

## Dirty logbook
I'll be documenting every thought I have in this file, whether I do it or not it is just to mirror whats on my mind every time I think of this tool. Find it here ![JOURNEY.md](JOURNEY.md)
